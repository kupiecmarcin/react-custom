# react-custom (udemy)

React-like spa application intended to show basics of promises, testing, error handling, etc.

## Goals

Main goal is to provide a simple boilerplate for a full-stack project.

### Front-end

- webpack basic set-up (babel, e6, eslint, test-runner)
- npm-scripts (start, build, test, serve)
- simple react-like app using jquery with need to call back-end API
- use of callbacks, promises and async/await to fetch data from server
- use of mocha/jasmine to test code, show how to test approaches mentioned above

### Back-end

- restfull node.js app using express.js
- provide small API with dummy data (resemble real-life scenario)
- neat error handling together with testing

### CI/CD

- set up github workflow (create branch->code->test->merge)
- set up github hooks?/travis CI/bamboo/bitbucket hooks to automatize releases and deployment
- if everything done and it still makes sense, add JIRa, with the project set up and instructions how to create sprint, add tasks, assign them, work on code, merge and deploy

## Intention
Main intention is to provide a entry-level tutorial on how to set up a project
with all necessary tools, show how to use them and describe different approaches.
The idea is not to use any of modern js frameworks (vue, angular, react) but only vanilla js es6.
This approach allows to see how different components work together and are served to the end user.
